Driver Laptimes Scatterplot
==============================

Plot a driver's lap times in a race, with color coding for the compounds.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 6-15

.. code-block:: default


    import fastf1
    import fastf1.plotting
    import seaborn as sns
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

    # The misc_mpl_mods option enables minor grid lines which clutter the plot
    fastf1.plotting.setup_mpl(misc_mpl_mods=False)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 16-17

Load the race session.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 17-21

.. code-block:: default


    race = fastf1.get_session(2023, "Azerbaijan", 'R')
    race.load()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 22-24

Get all the laps for a single driver.
Filter out slow laps as they distort the graph axis.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 24-27

.. code-block:: default


    driver_laps = race.laps.pick_driver("ALO").pick_quicklaps().reset_index()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 28-32

Make the scattterplot using lap number as x-axis and lap time as y-axis.
Marker colors correspond to the compounds used.
Note: as LapTime is represented by timedelta, calling setup_mpl earlier
is required.
